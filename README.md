# MiniMIPS-CPU
MiniMIPS is a fully simulated CPU built in MATLAB/Simulink. It uses a 5-stage pipeline and a custom instruction set. The model includes the data path and control logic for cycle-accurate execution. It's designed to run real assembly programs and accurately simulate hardware behavior, including handling stalls, forwarding, and branch flow.
